    <h2>Event Animator</h2>

    <p>
        <i>Event Animator</i> is a Unity tool designed for creating <strong>dynamic cinematics</strong>, meaning that cinematics can change based on various factors, allowing for flexibility in storytelling.

    <p>
        In the video, you can see a small example of its possible usage. The player approaches an area that triggers the <i>cinematic</i>. From this point, the predefined events unfold.

        What makes this tool interesting is that it's not like a traditional cinematic; it adapts to the player's position and actions. The length of the cinematic can vary based on the player's interactions, such as when the player presses a button to advance the dialogue.

        This tool is extremely powerful because it allows you to <strong>use methods of components directly from the editor</strong>, similar to Unity events, but with the advantage of passing any number of arguments of any type.

        Below, you can see how the method "SomeRandomFunction" from the "TestComponent" on the "MY_OBJECT" object is exposed for use in the Event Animator.

        In this video, you can see how the cinematic was created and the values of the keyframes.

    <h2>GST Editor</h2>

    <p>
        The <i>GST Editor</i> or <i>Game State Tree Editor</i> is a Unity tool that allows you to <strong>create a node structure representing the states of a game</strong>. With the states created, you can transition between them, making game elements and events differ depending on the current state or phase of the game.
    </p>

    <br>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="../files/tools/graph.png"><img>

    <br><br>

    <p>
        In a basic example, you can have states like <i>TUTORIAL</i> and <i>START</i>. When entering a scene, the game is in the <i>TUTORIAL</i> state. After completing the tutorial, it transitions to the <i>START</i> state. The next time you enter the same scene, it skips the tutorial because it's in the <i>START</i> state.

        This tool allows you to <strong>set up logic depending on the game phase directly in the Unity editor</strong>. Additionally, you can have multiple state tree setups because it uses a <i>ScriptableObject</i> to store the data.
