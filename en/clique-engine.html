        Clique Engine is a learning project through which I aim to explore the complex world of game engines by programming a small <strong>2D engine</strong> named Clique Engine. I've always been drawn to the idea of creating my own engine, and this curiosity has led me to read and learn a lot from articles by people who have been working on these technologies for years, defending certain architectures and explaining how things work internally.
        
        <br><br>

        Additionally, thanks to open-source projects like <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> and <a href="https://www.stride3d.net/">Stride</a>, I've had the opportunity to examine the source code of other engines. On some occasions, I've ventured to make pull requests or improvement proposals.

        <br><br>

        I've finally decided to start a project primarily for learning. The intention is not to create the perfect engine or one with many features. Instead, I aim to experiment with different architectures to better understand how a game engines works.

        Through experimentation, the idea is to refine the type of engine I want to create and gradually improve the code to make it as cohesive
		and simple as possible. I will be posting iterations with the progress.

	<h2>Iteration 2</h2>

	<p>
		In this version, I have implemented a much more robust interface system, in this case, with the help of Dear ImGui.
		This allows us to efficiently draw the UI on each frame. Additionally, by using the docking branch, we can easily customize
		the workspace. For now, the console is implemented, but creating new custom windows is very simple thanks to the
		<i>UIWindow</i> and <i>UIManager</i> classes. The <i>UIWindow</i> class serves as the foundation for any window in the
		engine, and the <i>UIManager</i> is responsible for managing the windows.

	<h2 id="it1">Iteration 1</h2>

	<p>

        The engine already has a first version. In this version, I've chosen NOT to use the Entity-Component-System (ECS) but rather opted for an approach more inspired by class inheritance in Godot.

        <br><br>

        The result of this initial sprint is a custom UI system used to build the engine's interface, an event system that handles input, 2D rendering, and an editor for real-time object manipulation, pausing, and viewing class properties. And this is just what you can see at first glance; there are many more components under the surface.

        Below is a short demonstration video.

        And here's a video of many frogs, which is always a good thing. I honestly can't remember how many objects are in this example or how many FPS it achieves, but I do know it's more than 60 on a laptop that's over seven years old. The video may make it seem like there are fewer due to its quality.
